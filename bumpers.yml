rules:
    - match: ' /tmp'
      send: Use a "tmp" directory in the project root instead.
    - match: 'go test '
      send: |
        **Direct replacement:** Simply replace `go test` with `just test-unit`:
        - `go test -v ./internal/cli -run TestName` → `just test-unit -v ./internal/cli -run TestName`
        - `go test ./...` → `just test-unit ./...`
        - `go test -timeout 10s ./pkg` → `just test-unit -timeout 10s ./pkg`
        
        **Other test commands:**
        - `just test` - Full test suite (recommended for commits)
        - `just test-integration` - Tests with dependencies  
        - `just test-e2e` - Complete system validation
        
        **Why this helps:** The `just` commands ensure consistent test execution across the team and integrate seamlessly with our TDD practices and coverage requirements.
