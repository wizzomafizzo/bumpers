# Package Reorganization Plan

**Status**: 🔵 Planning  
**Created**: 2025-08-26  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-26  

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the growing width of the `internal/` package structure and large file sizes by introducing a hierarchical organization that groups related functionality, splits oversized files, and establishes clearer boundaries between components.

## Current State Analysis

### Package Metrics

| Package | Files | Total Lines | Largest File | Lines | Issues |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------------|-------|--------|
| `cli` | 2 | ~850 | app.go | 708 | Orchestrator doing too much |
| `config` | 2 | ~400 | config.go | 340 | Mixed responsibilities |
| `transcript` | 2 | ~350 | reader.go | 279 | Complex parsing logic |
| `claude/settings` | 3 | ~350 | hooks.go | 255 | Event handling mixed with config |
| `ai` | 1 | ~150 | - | - | Could be part of platform |
| `matcher` | 1 | ~100 | - | - | Core business logic |
| `hooks` | 1 | ~120 | - | - | Event processing |
| `logger` | 1 | ~80 | - | - | Cross-cutting concern |
| `template` | 1 | ~100 | - | - | Part of messaging |
| `context` | 1 | ~80 | - | - | Part of messaging |

### Dependency Analysis

**High Coupling** (imports 5+ packages):
- `cli/app.go` → 9 internal packages
- `config/config.go` → 5 internal packages

**Widely Imported** (imported by 5+ packages):
- `constants` → Used everywhere
- `filesystem` → Used by 6 packages
- `config` → Used by 5 packages
