# Session Changes - Post-Tool-Use Hook Implementation
**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Branch:** `feature/post-tool-use-hooks`  
**Session Focus:** Complete post-tool-use hook functionality with efficient transcript parsing

## üéØ Session Overview

This session completed the post-tool-use hook implementation that was reported as not working properly. The main issues addressed were:

1. **Inefficient transcript reading** - Was reading entire large transcript files into memory
2. **Incorrect test data format** - Tests used single-line JSON instead of realistic JSONL format  
3. **Missing transcript reader** - No efficient parser for extracting Claude's reasoning
4. **Incomplete documentation** - Missing examples and configuration details

## üìÅ Files Created

### Core Implementation
- **`internal/transcript/reader.go`** - New efficient JSONL transcript reader
  - Extracts reasoning content from assistant messages
  - Pattern matching for reasoning indicators and completion status
  - Memory-efficient string-based JSON parsing (no full JSON unmarshaling)

### Test Data
- **`testdata/transcript-not-related.jsonl`** - Realistic JSONL transcript with failure attribution patterns
- **`testdata/transcript-no-match.jsonl`** - JSONL transcript with no matching patterns for negative testing

## üîß Files Modified

### Core Integration
- **`internal/cli/app.go`** - Integrated new transcript reader into PostToolUse processing
  - Added `transcript.ExtractReasoningContent()` call with error handling
  - Added targeted logging for PostToolUse debugging with transcript path and reasoning length
  - Preserved existing PostToolUse handler logic while adding efficient transcript reading

### Configuration Examples  
- **`bumpers.yml`** - Added working post-tool-use rule examples
  - Rules for delay analysis with AI-powered troubleshooting
  - Rules for failure attribution pattern detection  
  - Uses correct `event: post` and `fields: ["reasoning"]` syntax
  - Includes custom AI prompts for contextual analysis

- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Added post-tool-use configuration documentation
  - Explanation of `event: post` and `fields: ["reasoning"]` syntax
  - Configuration options and efficient processing details
  - Examples showing proper rule structure

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Efficient Transcript Reading
The new `ExtractReasoningContent` function processes JSONL files line-by-line without loading entire files into memory. It uses string-based JSON extraction for performance and filters assistant messages for reasoning patterns.

### Pattern Matching Strategy
- **Target patterns**: Common reasoning indicators and status messages
- **Message filtering**: Only processes `"type":"assistant"` entries  
- **Content extraction**: Uses string indexing to extract text content efficiently
- **Memory safety**: Processes one line at a time, no large memory allocations

### Integration Points
- **Hook routing**: PostToolUse hooks automatically extract reasoning when transcript path available
- **Rule matching**: Existing rule system matches against extracted reasoning content
- **Logging**: Debug logs show transcript processing status and reasoning length
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if transcript reading fails

## ‚úÖ Verification Results

### All Tests Passing
- `TestProcessHookRoutesPostToolUse` - Basic routing with realistic transcript data
- `TestPostToolUseWithDifferentTranscript` - Pattern matching verification  
- `TestPostToolUseRuleNotMatching` - Negative test with no-match transcript
- `TestPostToolUseWithCustomPattern` - Rule system integration
- All existing tests maintained backward compatibility

### Live Hook Testing
During the session, the implemented post-tool-use hooks actively provided guidance when relevant patterns were detected, proving the feature works end-to-end.

## üìã Configuration Syntax Clarification

### Correct Modern Syntax
```yaml
rules:
  - match: "pattern"
    tool: ".*"
    event: post              # Hook timing
    fields: ["reasoning"]    # Content source
    generate: session
    send: "Guidance message"
    prompt: "AI prompt"
```

### Backward Compatibility  
```yaml
rules:
  - match: "pattern"
    when: reasoning          # Expands to ["post", "reasoning"] 
    # ... rest of rule
```

## üéØ Key Achievements

1. **‚úÖ Efficient Processing** - No more loading entire transcript files into memory
2. **‚úÖ Realistic Test Data** - Updated from single-line JSON to proper JSONL format
3. **‚úÖ Working Implementation** - Post-tool-use hooks now actively provide guidance
4. **‚úÖ Proper Documentation** - Clear examples and configuration guidance
5. **‚úÖ Full Integration** - Seamless integration with existing rule and AI systems

## üîç Testing Approach

Followed strict TDD methodology throughout:
- **Red**: Write failing test first
- **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass  
- **Refactor**: Clean up implementation
- **Hook enforcement**: Bumpers hooks prevented over-implementation, ensuring proper TDD

## üí° Session Highlights

- **Real-world validation**: The implemented hooks immediately started working during development
- **TDD enforcement**: Bumpers own hooks enforced proper test-driven development  
- **Memory efficiency**: Solved the original concern about large transcript files
- **Pattern matching**: Successfully extracts Claude's reasoning for contextual guidance

## üöÄ Ready for Use

The post-tool-use hook feature is now fully functional and ready for production use. Users can configure rules with `event: post` and `fields: ["reasoning"]` to analyze Claude's reasoning patterns and provide intelligent guidance after tool execution.
