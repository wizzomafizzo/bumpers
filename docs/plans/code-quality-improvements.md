# Code Quality Improvements Plan

*Updated: 2025-09-01*

This document tracks code quality improvements identified during comprehensive review of `/internal/core/engine/` and subdirectories.

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED âœ…

All critical and high-priority improvements have been successfully implemented with full test coverage.

## Critical Issues

- [x] **Remove dead code** - Delete `/internal/core/engine/processor.go` entirely
  - Complete file is dead code with no functional implementation
  - Creates architectural confusion, maintenance overhead
  - No references found in codebase, actual processing handled by `cli.DefaultHookProcessor`

- [x] **Fix data structure completeness** - Complete `HookEvent` struct in `hooks/hooks.go:38-43`
  - Missing fields for PostToolUse events: `tool_response`, `session_id`, `hook_event_name`, `cwd`
  - Forces consumers to work with raw JSON, limits functionality
  - Add missing fields to support all hook types properly

## High Priority Improvements

- [x] **Fix timestamp handling** - `operation/operation.go:17,25`
  - Missing time package import, UpdatedAt set to 0 instead of current time
  - Import time package, set `UpdatedAt: time.Now().Unix()` in DefaultState()

- [x] **Improve hook type detection logic** - `hooks/hooks.go:68-81`
  - Fragile detection logic could misidentify hook types
  - Implement more specific identification using `hook_event_name` field
  - Prevent PostToolUse hooks being misidentified as PreToolUse

## Medium Priority Improvements

- [x] **Fix consistency in case sensitivity** - `operation/operation.go:48,60`
  - DetectTriggerPhrase is case-insensitive while DetectEmergencyStop is case-sensitive
  - Make both functions consistently case-insensitive

- [x] **Protect global state** - `operation/operation.go:30,36,42`
  - Exported slice variables can be modified externally
  - Make variables private, provide getter functions returning copies

- [ ] **Enhance error handling** - `matcher/matcher.go:63-65,83-85`
  - Silent regex compilation failures during matching
  - Add debug logging for invalid regex patterns

## Low Priority Enhancements

- [ ] **Improve code organization** - `matcher/matcher.go`
  - Single responsibility principle violation in `matchesRule()`
  - Split into focused methods: `matchesTool()` and `matchesCommand()`

- [ ] **Add input validation** - `matcher/matcher.go` & `hooks/hooks.go`
  - Add parameter validation to public methods
  - Better error messages, more robust API

- [ ] **Enhance testing coverage** - All files
  - Add missing edge case tests for malformed JSON
  - Add concurrent access tests
  - Add fuzz testing for DetectHookType in hooks package
  - Add tests for DefaultState() function

- [ ] **Extract magic strings to constants** - `hooks/hooks.go`
  - Hard-coded strings like "prompt", "tool_response", "SessionStart"
  - Define constants for field names and values

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. Remove `processor.go` (quick win, eliminates confusion)
2. Fix timestamp handling (critical functionality bug)
3. Complete HookEvent struct (functionality enhancement)
4. Fix hook type detection (correctness issue)
5. Address consistency issues (maintenance improvements)
6. Add comprehensive testing (quality assurance)

### Positive Observations
- Excellent test coverage with benchmarking and fuzz testing
- Clean package organization following Go conventions
- Good separation of concerns between packages
- Comprehensive error handling patterns
- Well-documented interfaces and functions

The codebase demonstrates solid engineering practices. The main issues are architectural clarity (dead code), missing functionality for complete hook event support, and some consistency improvements.
